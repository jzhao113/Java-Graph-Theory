# Java-Graph-Theory
This project was a something I worked on over the summer of 2019. I started this project because I was interested in graph theory and
wondered how it would look like in code. This project has code for Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, Kruskal's minimum spanning tree, 
and graph coloring. From this project I learned that it could be diffcult to represent certain concepts in code, and you have to be clever in
how you implement it. There's still a lot more improvements which can be made to my implementations.
